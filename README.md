HindmarshRose 1984 cell model

The Hindmarsh Rose model is a simplified point cell model which
captures complex firing patterns of single neurons, such as periodic
and chaotic bursting.

It in a fast spiking subsystem, which is a generalization of the
Fitzhugh-Nagumo system, coupled to a slower subsystem which allows the
model to fire bursts. 

The dynamical variables x,y,z correspond to the membrane potential, a
recovery variable, and a slower adaptation current, respectively.
