Hindmarsh Rose 1984 cell model
==============================

The Hindmarsh Rose model is a simplified point cell model which
captures complex firing patterns of single neurons, such as periodic
and chaotic bursting.

It has a fast spiking subsystem, which is a generalization of the
Fitzhugh-Nagumo system, coupled to a slower subsystem which allows the
model to fire bursts. 

The dynamical variables x,y,z correspond to the membrane potential, a
recovery variable, and a slower adaptation current, respectively.

Simulations conducted through [jNeuroML](https://github.com/NeuroML/jNeuroML).

Adding the environment variable JNML_HOME, pointing to the jNeuroML folder, as well as adding this path to the PATH variable will let you use the jnml utility from any folder.
